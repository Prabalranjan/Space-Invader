# Space-Invader
this is my first game using pygame library. anyone can contribute as much as features they can. 
pause button,
multiple enemies,
surprise enemies( speed enemies),
enemy fire options,
health to the spaceship,
or levels ..
please use comment line as much as you can so that beginners like me and many others can understand.


Thank you.
